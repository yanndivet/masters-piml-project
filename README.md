## ðŸŽ¯ Project Aims

This project looks at methods for estimating population-level parameters from indirect, noisy observations of multiple systems. Two approaches are compared:

1. **[Hierarchical Bayesian Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling) (HBMs)** uses [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) (specifically the No-U-Turn Sampler, a variant of [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo)) to explore the posterior distribution.
2. **Distribution-Matching (DM)** uses gradient descent to minimise a loss based on the Sliced-Wasserstein distance.

## ðŸ’¡ Main Takeaways

- **Use HBMs when uncertainty matters or when N is small; use DM when speed is essential and N is large.**
- While HBMs provide robust parameter estimation even with small populations, the DM methodâ€™s performance improves with larger population sizes. 
- HBMs become computationally more expensive as population size increases, which is not the case for DM.
- The framework for linear problems (i.e. [damped harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator)) generalises well to nonlinear systems (i.e. [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations)), though identifiability issues make parameter estimation harder.
- Both methods accurately estimate population means, but struggle more with population variances.
